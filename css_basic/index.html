    <p>Cosmology is the study of the origin, development, structure, history, and future of the entire universe.

      In modern science, cosmology is divided into two branches. Observational cosmology studies the universe using telescopes and other equipment to examine the direct evidence of the universe’s development and structure. Physical cosmology studies the structures and development of the universe and the physics that created them. It uses a mix of theory and experiments to construct and research cosmological models. These models are sometimes called “cosmologies.” They incorporate theories and the information collected by observational cosmology. Cosmology draws on advances from many scientific disciplines, including astrophysics, plasma physics, nuclear physics, particle physics, relativity, and quantum mechanics.
      
      The origins of today’s cosmology began with the discovery in the early 1500s by Nicolaus Copernicus that the Earth revolves around the Sun. The next step was the discovery in the late 1600s by Isaac Newton that objects in space behaved according to the same laws of physics as objects on Earth. The door to modern physical cosmology opened early in the 20th century with Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity, which offered a model of spacetime.
      
      Cosmologists today believe that ordinary matter—the kind of matter we interact with every day—is just a small part of the universe. Most scientists agree that dark energy and dark matter make up a huge percentage of the universe. In this theory, dark energy makes up more than two thirds of the universe. This dark energy may be the force that overcomes gravity and allows the universe to expand in what is called cosmic acceleration. Another quarter of the universe consists of dark matter in this model. This is a hypothesized form of matter that only interacts with normal matter through gravity, and it does not emit or absorb light, making it impossible for scientists to detect directly.
      
      Modern physical cosmology studies many broad areas that touch on astrophysics, nuclear physics, particle physics, and other areas. They include:
      
      The Big Bang. This is the process through which the universe expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature.
      The formation and evolution of the large-scale structure of the universe. This refers to the formation of the patterns of galaxies and groups of galaxies throughout the universe. The galaxies and this large-scale structure have their origins in the first fraction of a second after the Big Bang.
